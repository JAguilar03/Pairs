Above is the link to the build of the game 

Pairs is a classic memory-based card-matching game designed to challenge your focus and concentration. Your goal is simple: flip over cards, remember their positions, and find matching pairs to clear the board. Choose between Normal and Hard difficulty modesâ€”Normal offers a more relaxed experience with fewer cards, while Hard increases the number of cards and tests your memory with trickier layouts. Whether you're looking for a quick mental workout or a tougher challenge, Pairs is a fun and engaging way to put your memory skills to the test!
